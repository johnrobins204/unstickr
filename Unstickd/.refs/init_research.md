# 📑 Project Unstickd: Concept Paper & Market Research (2026)

**Sector:** EdTech / AI-Augmented Literacy

**Founder:** [Your Name]

**Location:** Manitoba, Canada

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Unstickd** is an evidence-based, AI-augmented writing environment for children (ages 6–12) that prioritizes the **creative process over the final product**. Unlike "Ghostwriting" AI tools that generate text for the user, Unstickd utilizes **Passive Socratic Intervention** to keep the child in the "Zone of Proximal Development."

The business employs a **B2B2C strategy**: offering the tool at-cost to school divisions as a teacher-augmentation utility, while monetizing through a premium home-tier subscription focused on digital continuity and physical keepsake publishing.

## 2. The Core Problem & Solution

| The Problem | The Unstickd Solution |
| --- | --- |
| **Academic Integrity:** AI tools often "ghostwrite," leading to learning loss and school bans. | **Zero-Ghostwriting Policy:** Hard architectural constraints prevent the AI from writing into the body text. |
| **Teacher Burnout:** Educators spend excessive 1:1 time managing "wiggles" and "stuck" students. | **Labor Augmentation:** The AI handles routine "nudging," allowing teachers to focus on high-need students. |
| **Cognitive Overload:** Students struggle to manage drafting, spelling, and plot simultaneously. | **Separation of Powers:** Interface strictly separates **Flow State** (Drafting) from **Learning Mode** (Review). |

## 4. Financial & Unit Economics

### 🤖 LLM Operating Costs (Pessimistic Model)

Using **Gemini 1.5/3 Flash** for low-latency, high-context Socratic interaction:

* **Cost per Student/Hour:**  CAD.
* **School Tier Pricing:** Aiming for **$0.50 – $1.00 per student/year** to ensure total market penetration without budget friction.

### 📔 The Keepsake Engine (Monetization)

* **Subscription:** $5/month (USD) for home-school sync and premium UI skins.
* **Physical Goods:** Print-on-Demand (POD) hardcover books.
* **Unit Cost:** ~$11.50 – $14.50 CAD (mixam.ca / Blurb).

## 🛡️ 5. Data Privacy & "The Parental Gate"

Unstickd is designed for **Privacy-by-Default** to bypass Canadian FIPPA/FOIP hurdles:

* **Anonymized Research:** Usage data informs creative writing literature, not individual profiles.
* **Sovereignty:** Children own their words.
* **The Gate:** Transition from school to home is explicitly parent-authorized, creating a high-trust signal that justifies the home subscription.
