This document outlines the Writing Quest Ecosystem, a standards-aligned, recursive writing framework designed to accelerate literacy outcomes through a five-stage pedagogical journey underpinned by a Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) foundation.

I. Core Framework: The Five Stages of Writing
The Writing Quest follows a linear yet recursive progression, bridging the gap between reading and professional-grade publication.

1. Reader
Phase: Inquiry & Research

Pedagogical Core: Deconstructive Analysis. Focuses on cultivating analytical reading skills by deconstructing mentor texts to bridge the gap between consumption and creation.

Curriculum Alignment: * GLO 2: Comprehend

GLO 3: Inquiry

Key Activity: Active text interrogation.

2. Planner
Phase: Pre-Writing Strategy

Pedagogical Core: Evidence-Based Scaffolding. Operationalizes the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) through visual graphic organizers that decompose complex narrative architectures.

Curriculum Alignment: * GLO 4: Plan

Indigenous Perspectives (Diverse archetypes and structures)

Key Activity: Strategic organization of ideas.

3. Drafter
Phase: Composition

Pedagogical Core: Cognitive Optimization. Maximizes "flow states" via a distraction-free interface designed to support sustained creative output.

Curriculum Alignment: * GLO 4: Generate

Differentiation (Inclusive typography for neurodiversity)

Key Activity: Sustained creative drafting.

4. Reviewer
Phase: Formative Assessment

Pedagogical Core: Metacognitive Development. Drives critical thinking by decoupling error detection from diagnosis, shifting the locus of control to the learner.

Curriculum Alignment: * Assessment as Learning

GLO 4: Appraise

Key Activity: Self-directed evaluation.

5. Editor
Phase: Revision & Publication

Pedagogical Core: Iterative Refinement. Mitigates revision anxiety through granular task segmentation to foster professional-grade editing habits.

Curriculum Alignment: * GLO 4: Edit

GLO 5: Community

Key Activity: Final polish for a target audience.

II. Foundation Layer: Social-Emotional Learning (SEL)
The entire ecosystem is built upon a Collaborative Learning Ecosystem designed to ensure psychological safety and visible growth.

Inclusive Engagement Model
Longitudinal Artifact Tracking: Students curate portfolios of their entire journey (ideation to publication) to foster a growth mindset.

Differentiated Social Scaffolding: Granular privacy controls (Private, Mentor, Small Group, Class) allow students to share at their individual comfort levels.

Psychologically Safe Feedback
Structured Peer Review: Utilizes a "Sticker-Only" protocol to eliminate negative social friction and reinforce positive behaviors/specific competencies.

Anxiety-Free Interaction: Restricts unstructured commentary to ensure a supportive environment focused on constructive recognition.
